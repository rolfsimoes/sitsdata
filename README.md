This project contains in situ data sets used in the e-sensing project. These data sets consists of time series of selected locations which are used to train machine learning models, csv files containing training locations, and data cubes to run examples of sits usage.

To load these data sets:

`devtools::install_github("e-sensing/sitsdata")`

## Time series samples for classification using machine learning

### Data availability 

R package `sitsdata` contains  time series to be used for classification with machine learning methods which are available when the package is loaded using `library(sitsdata)`. All satellite image time series have the following columns: 

- longitude (East-west coordinate of the time series sample in WGS 84).
- latitude (North-south coordinate of the time series sample in WGS 84).
- start_date (initial date of the time series).
- end_date (final date of the time series).
- label (the class label associated to the sample).
- cube (the name of the image data cube associated with the data).
- time_series (list  with the values of the time series).

### Land Use and Land Cover for Brazilian Cerrado using Landsat-8 OLI

This dataset was produced by a systematic sampling using a grid of 5km x 5km throughout the Cerrado biome, collecting 85,026 samples. The training data labels were extracted from three sources: the pastureland map of 2018 from Pastagem.org, MapBiomas Collection 5 for  2018, and Brazil's National Mapping Agency IBGE maps for 2016-2018. Out of the 85,026 samples, the authors selected those where there was no disagreement between the labels assigned by the three sources. The resulting set had 48,850 points from which the authors extracted time series using a Landsat-8 data cube for year 2018. The distribution of samples for each class is the following: `Annual Crop` (6887), `Cerradao` (4211), `Cerrado` (21,909), `Natural Non Vegetated` (38), `Pasture` (12,894), `Perennial Crop` (68), `Silviculture` (805), `Sugarcane` (1775), and `Water` (263).

### LULC Cerrado classification validation

This dataset provides samples used for validation of the Cerrado LULC classification (see above). The authors did a systematic sampling of the Cerrado biome using a 20 x 20 km grid with a total of 5402 points. These samples are independent of the training set used in the classification. They were interpreted by five specialists using high resolution images from the same period of the classification. This resulted in 5286 evaluation samples thus distributed: "Annual Crop" (553), "Cerrado" (3155), "Natural Non Vegetated" (44), "Pasture" (1246), "Perennial Crop" (38), "Silviculture" (94), "Sugarcane" (77), and "Water" (79).

### Rwanda Crop Type Classification Dataset

RTI International (RTI) generated 2,611 labeled point locations representing 19 different land cover types, clustered in 5 distinct agroecological zones within Rwanda. These land cover types were reduced to three crop types (Banana, Maize, and Legume), two additional non-crop land cover types (Forest and Structure), and a catch-all Other land cover type to provide training/evaluation data for a crop classification model.

### Uganda Crop Type Classification Dataset

This dataset contains crop types and field boundaries along with other metadata collected in a campaign run by Dalberg Data Insights in the end of September 2017, as close as possible to the harvest period of 2017.
